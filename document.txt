The Space Debris Visualization Application -- Prototype Version 

Author: Yunzhong He (hyz331@gmail.com)

[Overview]
This is the documentation for SDV(Space Debris Visualization). This document
will evolve through out the development process.

[Technologies]
Since Space-track offers a RESTful API, we do not need to build a backend. And
the entire project will be a pure client-side app. I have looked at different
front-end frameworks and found EmberJS to be a good fit. It offers MVC framework
for seperation of components, and it supports RESTful API by nature (then we do
not need to parse URLs and build queries by hand)

[Division of Work]
Since currently different people are exploring different kinds of
visualizations, it's hard to work out something together. And the hope of this
prototype is to provide a framework so that everyone can easily add his
visualizations into it.

[Progress]
I figured out how to use EmberJS, and worked out the basic controller and view
structures. I have also added basic UI using Twitter Bootstrap, which can be 
found by clicking index.html directly. 

There is a search bar on top so that people can use it to find out intersting 
satellite to visulize, and below is a nevigation bar for displaying different
visualizations. Currently I'm working on a backend to fetch data and display
it using simple tables under the "Table" tab, and other visualizaions may
be added under different tabs, using the same data obtained by my backend.
